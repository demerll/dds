### OLLAS Description

The Office of Latino/Latin American Studies (OLLAS) was created to ensure that UNO students and the community have the education and the skills needed to understand the connection of Latinos, Latin America and some of the most important issues of our times. Understanding the multiple root causes and socio-economic, political and cultural impacts of these populations has become a critical component of a true liberal arts education and is central to the development of an informed and engaged citizenry.
