### Introduction

Operations Research is the application of advanced analytical methods to enable better decision making. A plethora of problems may be solved using Operations Research; among these are:

- Determining the route a delivery truck should take in order to make all deliveries while traveling the fewest number of miles.
- Determining the best location for a new facility such as a fire station.
- Scheduling airline flights and crew.
- Determining the optimal distribution of bicycles in a bike sharing system.

Operations Research includes problem-solving methods such as deterministic and stochastic optimization, machine learning, and simulation.

### Concentrations in Operations Research

This concentration is recommended for students interested in a career as an Operations Research Analyst or in pursuing a graduate degree in Operations Research or a related field.

The broad real-world applicability of Operations Research makes it an attractive choice for Math majors. In Operations Research courses, students get a solid background in mathematical modeling of decision-making problems, algorithms for solving different types of these problems, as well as experience using appropriate software tools.
